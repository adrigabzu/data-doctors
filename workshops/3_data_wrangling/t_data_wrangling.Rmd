Data like the world, can seem chaotic. In order to ask questions we have to transform the data into useful structures that the we and the computer can interact with.

![](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/SickLeftAfricanfisheagle-size_restricted.gif)

In this workshop we will be using the the [`tidyverse` library](https://www.tidyverse.org/), a collection of R packages that acts as an extra layer of interaction between base R and the user without significant impacts in performance. If you haven't installed it, do it by copying the following line in the `Console` panel after the `>`: 

```r
install.packages("tidyverse")
```
Hit `Enter`, the download and installation process should start. When finished, load the library by executing:

```{r echo=TRUE, message=TRUE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE, results='asis', collapse=TRUE}
library("tidyverse")
```

Above you can see all the libraries contained in tidyverse to be loaded. Some other libraries that might be useful to install are:

```r
install.packages(c("readxl", "psych", "skimr"))
```

# Importing data into R

## The source of the data

It is recommended to [take care of your folder structure](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000424) by making organising your project with at least 3 folders, one for your scripts, one for your data and another one for results. To avoid problems with paths:

1. Create an empty file that will contain your script with the extension `.R` in the end.
2. Execute the script using Rstudio.
3. To know where your current R is looking at execute `getwd()`

## The path to the data

Computer locations are structured as layers one contained in the other. In order to navigate the folder structure we have to know that:

![](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/ForthrightCrazyCirriped-size_restricted.gif)

- `./` Current location
- `../` Out of the current location. It can be stacked e.g. `../../`
-  `/` root (usually where the important files for the system are located)
- `~/` home directory where you can #hygge

 You can change this locations by giving full directions from the root or relative to the current folder using `setwd("./directions/tofolder/inside")`

## The nature of the data

Data can come in multiple formats. Look at the file extension of your data file or have a look in a text editor how it is formated. Look at the middle column of first page of the [Data Import Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/data-import.pdf). Load the data into a variable such as `my_data`.

## Data frames vs Tibbles

Tables in base R are considered as `data.frame`. Tibbles are an improved version of the data.frame, when files are imported using `read_` these are formatted as Tibbles. Look at the difference by running the commands `as.data.frame(my_data)` and `as_tibble(my_data)`

# Column names and formats

When importing tables, the type of data in each column is guessed but it can also be specified. You can explore your dataset using `view()` in an interactive way (a new tab opens). Have a `glimpse()` to the imported dataset and recognise the data type of the columns:

|          | Description                 | Example                             |
|----------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| ``int``  | integers                    | 1, 2, 3 ,4                          |
| ``dbl``  | doubles or real numbers     | 1.0, 2.3, 3.623, 4.78               |
| ``chr``  | characters or string (text) | "Hello", "wild-type", "1"           |
| ``dttm`` | date-times                  | "2018-06-09 16:45:40"               |
| ``lgl``  | logical                     | TRUE / FALSE                        |
| ``fctr`` | factors                     | 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4 Levels: 1, 2, 3, 4 |
| ``date`` | dates                       | "2018-06-09"                        |

Column types can be reformatted at any time.

> Whenever is possible avoid spaces in your column names

# Long vs wide datasets

Tables can be found in mainly designs:

+ In **Wide format** all observations for each sample or subject will be contained in one row accross multiple columns
+ In **Long format** (or tidy) each observation is in its own row, and each variable type in its own column. There are multiple rows for each sample or subject.

In the middle column, page 2 of the [Data Import Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/data-import.pdf) you can find how to tidy your data to the suitable format. In short:

- `gather()` to go from wide to long format
- `spread()` to go from long to wide format

# Pipes

![](http://www.abandonia.com/files/games/630/Pipe%20Mania_1.png)

One of the best enhancenments in R are pipes. They can be used to concatenate commands using `%>%`. This will pass the result of one function to as the first argument of the next function. In Windows pipes can also be introduced by `Ctrl + shift + M`. Example:

```r
myresults <- mydata %>%
  select(column1, column2, 3:10, -column9) %>%
  filter(column1 < 0.05)
```

# Explore your data

There are many things you can do with your dataset. A suggested way of operating would be:

1. Clarify your questions or idea of what you want to see
2. Check the [Data Transformation Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/data-transformation.pdf) to find the functions you need to answer your questions
3. If the cheat sheet is not enough search your problem on internet by ading `tidyverse`, `dplyr` or `R` at the end of your query

A brief summary of things you can do:
+ `select()` columns
+ `filter()` values in columns
+ `arrange()` your data in a ascending or `arrange(desc())` in descending order
+ `mutate()` to create new columns or overwrite existing ones
+ `pull()` a specific column as a vector
+ `rename()` columns

## Group your data

Considering that your data is in long format you can group your observations based on a specific column using `group_by(column_name)`. This will allow you to perform operations and run functions per group instead of the whole dataset.

## Combine datasets

Combining tables is inspired on SQL. 

## Summarise your data

Custom summaries reports can be created by using `summarise()`. Despite being flexible, this requires a detailed specification of the types of summaries we want to see such as mean, median, maximum values, etc. Packages like `skimr` or `psych` provide a set of out of the box summary statistics for your data. Examples based on the built in dataset `esoph`:

```{r echo=TRUE, message=TRUE, warning=F, paged.print=TRUE, results='hold',collapse=TRUE}
library(skimr)

esoph %>% skim() %>% print()

```

```{r echo=TRUE, message=TRUE, warning=F, paged.print=TRUE, results='hold',collapse=TRUE}
library(psych)

esoph %>% describe()

```
